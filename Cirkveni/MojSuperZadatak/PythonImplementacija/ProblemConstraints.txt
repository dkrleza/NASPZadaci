Binary Tree
->Node has 2 children links, but no parent link
->Nodes are sorted

Mirror operation
->Replace right with left child (swap) for all nodes
->Do it in O(n) time
---> O(n*log(n)) not good enough, so no return from root!
->Use O(1) (constant) additional space
---> Root->child1->child2->....->target stack not allowed!
